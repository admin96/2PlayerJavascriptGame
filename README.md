# Why I did I write this code?

So, I was showing my family this software called [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows) and even though I was quite fascinated with being able to move around my mouse with a PS4 controller, they were severly unimpressed with this. So, we needed a game to play!
